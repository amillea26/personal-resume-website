    <h2> Backstory </h2>
    <img class="border" src="ct.jpg"/> <p> Growing up, in Connecticut, I was highly influenced by many people to have jobs like a nurse, lawyer, doctor, ect. But it never stood out to me. My love for the flim industry grew when everyone used to tell me how outgoing and "sassy" my personality is,and since in the envirnoment I grew up in, there's not that much resources for me to even become a model. Since Connecticut isn't the biggest state in America. But that setback only made me want to achieve my dreams even more.

It also aligns with things I love most, like, helping others, flim, photography, and architecture.</p>
