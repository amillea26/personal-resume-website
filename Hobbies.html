    <h1> Hobbies </h1>
    <h2> Cheer </h2>
    <img class="border" src="cheer.png"/> <p> Cheer is the first sport I offically joined. I started cheering in August 2022 of my freshman year, and I have been cheering since. 9th and 10th grade I was a cheerleader on JV, but as of this year. Im a member on Varsity. Cheerleading made me learn the act of teamwork, A strong work ethic, and confidence. </p>

    <h2> Volleyball </h2>
    <img class="border" src="volleyball.png"/><p> I've been loving volleyball since 2020, but was always too scared to join, but as of August 2024. I joined the volleyball team, and made JV and Varsity. I was new to the sport, but quickly settled into the way of the game. Volleyball made me learn sportsmanship, discipline, and commitment. </p>
